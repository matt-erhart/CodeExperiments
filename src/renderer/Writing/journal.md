looked at different ways of making a mini-language
    - consider just using mdx and all that first?
    - jupyter and codemirror extension also could work, probably better to do first
    - vscode extension language server protocol could work
        - requires textmate grammar which is basicly a tree of regexs
    - babel macros can also transform a text document into other stuff
        - may want preval to get autocomplete on transformed text
    - should start with just regex
    - consider mermaid, yuml, and plantuml (most popular)


Ambiguity is harder to code with scopes, i.e. want to make the scopes larger so instead of 'this effect' used 'this *harvest* effect' so that harvest effect could be regexed up top.
